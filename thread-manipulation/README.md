- I wanted ChatGPT to summarise a LinkedIn thread for me, but I was using the free version at the time and 
  - it couldn't access LinkedIn threads via links cos couldn't log in
  - it couldn't cope with the amount of text involved in copy/pasting from LinkedIn(cos max text limit)
- So I wanted to reduce the number of characters by extracting only the interesting stuff and none of the crud
- It wasn't perfect (some text got lost, some text I didn't want stayed in), but the script was pretty good. 
- What was really impressive was that it created a interactable deployable mini web app, with UI
- It did a good enough job, and then I stopped tinkering to prioritise other things
- In the end I upgraded to paid ChatGPT, which had higher text limit and the ability to upload files, so I didn't actually need the tool any more
